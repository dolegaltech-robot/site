# What is legal tech

The definition of <em>legal tech</em> is often debated, but usually irrelevant in practice. <em>Do Legal Tech</em> takes the view that legal tech is wide enough to capture all of the following:

## Everyday tools

These are things such as laptops, office productivity, email and legal research solutions. Lawyers cannot do their work without these tools. Everyday tools are often forgotten about, but are tend to already have wholescale adoption.

They may or may not be specific to the legal industry. For example, [Relativity](https://www.relativity.com/) has become an everyday tool for many law firms to manage disclosure and discovery exercises in large litigation: they cannot manage their processes without it.


:::info Examples

[Office 365](https://www.office.com/) (for documents), [iManage Work](https://imanage.com/products/work/) (for storing documents), [Practical Law](http://www.practicallaw.com/) (for legal research), [Relativity](https://www.relativity.com) (for litigation)

## Emerging tools

These are tools used by lawyers that are specific to legal work (or that produce an output for clients and anybody else that interacts with the legal system) that are newer than everyday tools, and may not (yet) have widespread adoption. This is probably what you think of when you first think about legal tech.

Many of these tools  may claim to harness [machine learning](./key-concepts/artificial-intelligence). Some are "point solutions" - i.e. they have a niche application for a particular process in a particular type of work in a particular jurisdiction. For example, [10be5](https://10be5.com/) is a tool that introduces efficiencies for capital markets transactions when complying with Rule 10b-5 under the US Exchange Act of 1934.

Tools in this category may progress to become everyday tools. Examples include [Zoom](https://zoom.us/), [Microsoft Teams](https;//teams.microsoft.com) and [DocuSign](https://docusign.com) - all of which were rarely adopted by legal professionals prior to 2020, but are now everyday tools many organisations.

[Kira Systems](https://kirasystems.com/) (for due diligence), [10b5](https://10be5.com) (for capital markets disclosures), [Legatics](https://www.legatics.com/) (for managing transactions), [Office & Dragons](https://www.officeanddragons.com/) (for repetitive work on sets of documents)

The [Legaltech Hub](https://www.legaltechnologyhub.com/) is an excellent database of legal tech solutions that includes many more examples.

## Process changes

The approach suggested on this site is that it is preferable to focus more on the outcomes delivered by a particular change, rather than the means through which the change is effected. On this basis, legal tech is seen as including initiative (technology or not) that creates improvements in the practice of law.

It is often prudent to consider whether a given outcome can be delivered more cheaply *without* resort to legal tech tools at all. Perhaps controversially, this means we include process changes within the definition of legal tech, even they do not actually involve technology.

:::info Examples

At a law firm, prompt time recording is a problem. If lawyers only record their time for a given day 14 days after that day passes, it might not be captured by a bill issued to client. It is difficult to recover this time later down the line. A process may be put in place that mandates that lawyers must record their time within a specific time period.

Associates often complain that the way they work varies based on which partner they work with in their team. Associates and partners may wish to discuss best practices around ways of working, and make sure they observe these (e.g. "no markups to be provided by pen and paper").

## Does the definition matter?

It does not. The approach advocated on this site is to focus on the *outcomes* delivered by a particular change, rather than the means used to achieve them. It is often far cheaper to focus on process changes rather than technology. So, why *does* legal tech matter, however you define it? Read on...
