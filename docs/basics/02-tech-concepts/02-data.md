# Data

It's easy to think that data is the domain of data scientists and computer programmers, but it's not. Any discussion of data must be founded in the actual use cases you might get from collecting, analysing or processing it.

As always, with any tech project, it is important to approach any discussion around data with questions such as, *"why are we doing this"*, *"what are we trying to achieve"* and *"what problem are we solving"*.

If you encounter a process that is currently implemented by "finger in the air exercises", the experiences of certain individuals or run entirely by anecdotal evidence, it is likely that collecting, processing and analysing data may provide a solution.

:::info Example
Law firms are often asked to provide fee estimates for new client projects. Firms may struggle to recover any fees they incur that exceed that estimate.

The problem is that these fee estimates are often calculated in an unscientific manner, based on whatever happened in the last project, or on people's personal experiences.

Instead, some law firms capture information relating to each matter they conduct. This is not only financial information, but also data about the characteristics of the matter. This can enable firms to develop models that help them more accurately predict how much matters might cost in the future.
