# Data

It's easy to think that data is the domain of data scientists and computer programmers, but it's not. Any discussion of data must be founded in the actual use cases you might get from collecting, analysing or processing it.

As always, with any tech project, it is important to approach any discussion around data with questions such as, *"why are we doing this"*, *"what are we trying to achieve"* and *"what problem are we solving"*.

If you encounter a process that is currently implemented by "finger in the air exercises", the experiences of certain individuals or run entirely be anecdotal evidence, it is likely that collecting, processing and analysing data may provide a solution.
